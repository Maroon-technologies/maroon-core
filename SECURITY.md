# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please disclose it responsibly:

1. Create a private support case or email security@maroontechnologies.org with details.
2. Include steps to reproduce, impact, and an optional proof-of-concept.
3. We'll acknowledge receipt and work to remediate as quickly as possible.

We will follow responsible disclosure and will not publicize details until fixes are available.
