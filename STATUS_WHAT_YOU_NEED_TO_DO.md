# What's Ready vs. What Needs Action

## ❌ I CANNOT Do (Need YOUR Action)

### 1. Send Emails

- **Why**: I don't have email access
- **What I Did**: Created complete email draft at `Maroon-Core/patents/EMAIL_TO_SEAN_DRAFT.md`
- **What YOU Need to Do**: Copy that email, attach the files, send to Sean

### 2. Create Live Google Workspace Documents

- **Why**: I can only create files on your computer, not in Google Drive
- **What I Did**: Created detailed outlines for:
  - Google Slides (19-slide presentation)
  - Google Sheets (10-tab financial model)
- **What YOU Need to Do**:
  - Open Google Slides → paste content from outline
  - Open Google Sheets → create tabs and formulas per outline

### 3. Deploy to Cloud (GCP/AWS)

- **Why**: Requires your cloud credentials and billing setup
- **What I Did**: Complete AWS deployment specs
- **What YOU Need to Do**: Run `terraform apply` when ready

## GCP Free Resources Status

**Currently Using**:

- ✅ Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro) - via workspace credits ($750 budget)
