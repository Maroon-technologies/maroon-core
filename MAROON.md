# MAROON.md: The Sovereign Operating System

## Core Philosophy: The Creative Charter

The Maroon Empire is built on three foundational principles:

1. **Sovereignty**: Complete ownership of corpus, logic, and infrastructure
2. **Hierarchy**: Meaning is structured, defensible, and legally traceable
3. **Adaptability**: Systems evolve without compromising core principles

---

## The Maroon Ontology: From Signal to Sovereignty

### Level 1: Signal (Raw Corpus Ingestion)

Corpus collected from external sources:

- Regulatory signals (WSDA, USDA, WIC/EBT regulations)
- Market signals (Zillow API, BCG Matrix analysis)
- Patent landscapes (USPTO, Google Patents)
- Community signals (Food deserts, EBT accessibility)

### Level 2: Pattern (Observation)

Identifying recurring themes and anomalies:

- Food access gaps in underserved communities
- Regulatory opportunities (SB 5605, microenterprise kitchens)
- Patent claim overlaps and white spaces
- Market inefficiencies in EBT/WIC systems

### Level 3: Protocol (Operational Logic)

Standard operating procedures triggered by patterns:

- **Nanny Protocol**: Commissary infrastructure deployment
- **Truth Teller Protocol**: Integrity-based prediction engine
- **EBT Split Protocol**: Transaction apparatus for WIC/EBT
- **Onitas Protocol**: Direct-to-consumer food platform

### Level 4: Ontology (Governance)

Overarching rules defining system behavior:

- Human judgment remains paramount
- All decisions must be legally defensible
- Corpus integrity verified at every layer
- Systems self-correct based on truth signals

## Current State: Production Readiness

### Budget Allocation

- **GCP Credits**: $750 (Google for Startups application pending)
- **AWS Activate**: Application in progress
- **Current Spend**: $15 of $150 operational budget
- **Free Tier Priority**: Maximizing zero-cost resources first

### MVP Status

1. **Nanny (Commissary)**: Spec complete, deployment pending
2. **Truth Teller**: Engine designed, GCP integration needed
3. **Onitas Market**: Patent claims finalized, prototype pending
4. **EBT Split**: Transaction flow documented, testing required

### Corpus Status

- **Analysis Outputs**: 130 placeholder files (EMPTY - needs population)
- **Ontology**: MASTER_ONTOLOGY.md and DATABASE_SCHEMA.md defined
- **Business Docs**: GCP application, startup credits plan, financial ledger
- **Specs**: Engineering guidelines, MVP definitions

## Immediate Priorities

### System Optimization

1. Clear 41GB CloudDocs session folder (causing M4 crashes)
2. Migrate to cloud-only workflow (no local AI models)
3. Free disk space to <80% usage
4. Stop runaway iCloud sync processes

### Corpus Consolidation

1. Populate 130 empty analysis_outputs files
2. Replace all "data" references with "corpus"
3. Create comprehensive corpus taxonomy
4. Map corpus to ontology levels

### Cloud Migration

1. Push Maroon-Core to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Copilot integration
3. Configure Google Drive API for cloud-only access
4. Deploy Truth Teller to GCP Vertex AI

### Financial Clarity

1. Confirm GCP credit balance
2. Track AWS Activate application
3. Document all free tier services
4. Clarify total available budget

## The Maroon Way: Operational Principles

1. **Corpus, Not Data**: We work with structured, verified corpus, not raw data
2. **Truth First**: Every decision traced back to verified signals
3. **Human Judgment**: AI augments, humans decide
4. **Legal Defensibility**: Every action must withstand scrutiny
5. **Sovereign Infrastructure**: Own the stack, own the future
6. **Vertical Philanthropy**: Profit serves community infrastructure
7. **Durable Systems**: Built to outlast individual contributors
