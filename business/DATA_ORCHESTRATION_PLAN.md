# Maroon Empire: Data Analysis & Sheets Integration Plan

## 1. Google Sheets Inventory

We will create a multi-tabbed Google Sheet to track:

- **Capital**: Status of AWS/GCP startup credits ($150 budget management).
- **Assets**: Inventory of all 5 Maroon entities and their registration status.
- **People**: The 1M+ person analysis database progress.

## 2. Notebook Analysis (Antigravity/Local)

- Use Jupyter/Notebook cells to run "Trend Analysis" on the `conversations.json`.
- **Primary Inquiry**: Correlation between WA State regulatory shifts and Maroon project pivots over the last 24 months.

## 3. Truth Teller Integration

The `Truth Teller` engine will publish its high-integrity markers directly to a "Clean" tab in the shared Google Sheet for executive review.
