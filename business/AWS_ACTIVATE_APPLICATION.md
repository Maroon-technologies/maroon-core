# Maroon Empire: AWS Activate Startup Application

## Company Information

- **Company Name**: Maroon Foods / Onitas Market
- **Sector**: Retail / Logistics / FinTech
- **Location**: Washington State

## The Product

**Onitas Market** is a sovereign food marketplace designed specifically to handle complex regulatory requirements for WIC and EBT transactions. Our proprietary **EBT Split Apparatus** (Patent Pending) allows for seamless, real-time transaction forking at the point of sale.

## Technical Architecture

Onitas Market is built on a serverless microservices architecture to handle high-concurrency during peak food-access distribution windows.

- **Payment Processing**: AWS Lambda + DynamoDB for high-speed split calculation (<200ms).
- **Logistics**: Real-time integration with ShipDay and Shopify via EventBridge.
- **Infrastructure**: Amazon S3 for regulatory receipt storage and auditing.

## Use of AWS Credits

The AWS Activate credits ($10k - $100k) will fund our initial production pilot in King County, WA. We aim to scale to 10k transactions per day within the first 6 months, requiring robust, scalable infrastructure that AWS provides.

## Innovation

We are the first Black-owned company to implement a sovereign, audited split-transaction logic that directly addresses the "Hidden Profit Gem" of commissary kitchens as identified in the 2025 BCG Matrix.
