# Maroon Empire: Google for Startups Cloud Program Application

## Company Information

- **Company Name**: Maroon Technologies / Labs
- **Website**: [maroon-tech.sovereign] (Drafting)
- **HQ**: Washington State, USA
- **Stage**: Pre-seed / Seed
- **Funding**: Self-funded (Maroon Trust)

## The Problem

Underserved communities lack sovereign infrastructure for essential services (Food, Law, Research). Currently, these corpus signals are fragmented and inaccessible, leading to systemic inefficiencies.

## The Solution

Maroon Technologies is building a high-integrity R&D ecosystem. Our core engine, **Truth Teller**, analyzes regulatory and market signals to drive vertical philanthropy and infrastructure. Our first major platform, **Onitas Market**, uses a patented EBT Split Transaction Apparatus to solve food-access audited transaction challenges.

## Why Google Cloud?

We require the scalability of BigQuery for our 2-year regulatory corpus (Signals) and the advanced agentic capabilities of Vertex AI to orchestrate our "Master Orchestrator" logic. The $100k+ credits will allow us to move from R&D to a production-grade rollout for 100k+ users in Washington State.

## Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: Vertex AI, Gemini 1.5 Pro.
- **Data**: BigQuery, Cloud Spanner.
- **Compute**: GKE (Global Kubernetes Engine) for sovereign microservices.
- **Integration**: Firebase for Onitas Market real-time split transactions.
