# Maroon-Core: Master Index

Welcome to the central intelligence hub for the Maroon-Core system. This repository organizes the patterns, systems, businesses, and ontologies developed across previous phases into a cohesive, engineering-ready structure.

## System Architecture Overview

The Maroon-Core system is built on a hierarchical operational ontology designed for sovereign, enterprise-grade scalability.

### Directory Structure

- **[ontology/](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/ontology/)**: Defines the "Pathology" of systems and the core operational language.
- **[business/](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/business/)**: Business logic, market analysis, and revenue models (e.g., Ghost Kitchens, Commissary Units).
- **[specs/](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/specs/)**: High-level engineering requirements and technical roadmaps.
- **[legal/](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/legal/)**: Patent drafts, governance frameworks, and regulatory compliance (WA State focus).
- **[mvp/](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/mvp/)**: Active product development, starting with the `nanny` project.

## Core Philosophical Tenets (The Creative Charter)

1. **Sovereignty**: Ownership of data, logic, and infrastructure.
2. **Hierarchy**: Meaning is structured and defensible.
3. **Adaptability**: Systems learn and evolve without breaking core principles.

## Roadmap: The Next 60 Minutes

1. **Fill Ontological Gaps**: Document the "System Pathology" and "Signal Ingestion" logic.
2. **Standardize Business Logic**: Consolidate the Washington State commissary research into actionable specs.
3. **Plan GCP Deployment**: Allocate $1300 budget for BigQuery datasets and Vertex AI agentic workflows.
