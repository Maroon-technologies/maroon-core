# Maroon-Core: Knowledge Synthesis Log

This log tracks the "Learn and Rewrite" mission, documenting specific findings from the two-year corpus for user validation.

## Phase 0: Thematic Mapping (COMPLETE)

**Finding**: The corpus is structured around five core pillars:
1. **NASA-Grade Governance** (NPD 7120.6A)
2. **Food-Access Infrastructure** (Commissary/WIC)
3. **Sovereign Capital** (GCP/AWS Credits)
4. **IP Defensibility** (Patent Portfolios)
5. **Operational Philosophy** (Vertical Philanthropy / Pathology)

## Phase 1: The Creative Charter (PENDING)

**Goal**: Extract the core "Orchestrator" logic from the `Creative Charter` and `System Pathology` notes.
