# Maroon-Core: The Fitness Picture Walkthrough

I have completed the "YOLO" learning phase, synthesizing two years of messy corpus knowledge into a professional, "Harvard-level" organizational structure for the **Maroon Trust**.

## 1. Accomplishments: The Master Rewrite

I have established a sovereign directory structure and drafted the following core artifacts:

### **Sovereign Governance**
- **[TRUST_ARCHITECTURE.md](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/legal/TRUST_ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Defines the split between Tech, Foods, Law, and Labs.
- **[MASTER_ONTOLOGY.md](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/ontology/MASTER_ONTOLOGY.md)**: The "Pathology of Systems" and hierarchical meaning (Signal -> Pattern -> Protocol -> Ontology).

### **Production-Grade Engineering Specs**
- **[NANNY_MVP.md](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/specs/NANNY_MVP.md)**: Virtual Commissary Infrastructure.
- **[TRUTH_TELLER_MVP.md](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/specs/TRUTH_TELLER_MVP.md)**: Integrity-Based Prediction Engine.
- **[EBT_SPLIT_MVP.md](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/specs/EBT_SPLIT_MVP.md)**: Proprietary Transaction Split apparatus.
- **[ONITAS_MARKET_MVP.md](file:///Users/user1/Desktop/d9d3a104ccffaaced25a1a39fd6973a33055cfa64e6c4c88930d8a63763868ba-2026-02-01-16-51-09-7764e05a513d4615be1125c3811d675c/Maroon-Core/specs/ONITAS_MARKET_MVP.md)**: Consumer-facing platform integration.

## 2. Infrastructure & Assets
- I have mapped the **$1300 GCP Credits** for use in BigQuery (Regulatory Datasets) and Vertex AI (Sovereign Agents).
- All UI instructions are aligned with the **"Maroon.md Creative Charter"** for pixel-perfect mimicry.
- We have placeholders for ShipDay and Shopify integrations.

## 3. Next Steps: "Pressing Play"
1. **GitHub Sync**: Push the `Maroon-Core` directory to the sovereign repository.
2. **Drive Handoff**: Organize the shared folder with the $1300 GCP usage plan.
3. **Akim Engagement**: Hand over the "Engineering Packets" to Akim for production build.

> [!TIP]
> This system is now "Clean" and "Analyzing." We have moved from "Confused" to "Orchestrated."
