# Maroon-Core: Knowledge Synthesis Log

This log tracks the "Learn and Rewrite" mission, documenting specific findings from the two-year corpus for user validation.

## Phase 0: Thematic Mapping (COMPLETE)

**Finding**: The corpus is structured around five core pillars:

- **Pillar 1: Maroon Trust** - The sovereign owner of all entities; Emmanuel Washington as the Orchestrator.
- **Pillar 2: Maroon Tech/Labs** - The R&D hub; engineering packets for Akim; research technology agents.
- **Pillar 3: Maroon Foods** - Onitas Market; Commissary Infrastructure (Nanny Project); WIC/EBT Split Transactions.
- **Pillar 4: Maroon Law** - Virtual Volunteer Law Firm; Intellectual Property (Patents for Truth Teller, EBT).
- **Pillar 5: Systemic Governance** - NASA-Grade (NPD 7120.6A) standards; Master Ontology.

## Phase 1: The Maroon.md Deep Dive (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal**: Extract instructions from `Maroon.md` (specifically within ChatGPT exports) and establish the production-grade MVP specs.

- [ ] Locate and transcribe `Maroon.md` creative instructions.
- [ ] Map "Truth Teller" and "EBT Split" patent logic.
- [ ] Define "Onitas Market" and "Nanny" technical requirements.
