# Maroon-Core Synthesis and Organization Plan

This plan outlines the steps to "learn and rewrite" the Maroon-core system, transforming messy exports and documents into a structured, engineering-ready ontology and organizational hierarchy.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will be creating new directories within the workspace to organize the knowledge. If you have specific naming conventions or existing folder structures you prefer, please let me know.

## Proposed Changes

### Knowledge Organization [NEW]

We will create a structured hierarchy in a new `docs/` directory or within a designated `Maroon-Core/` root folder:

- `ontology/`: Operations ontology, pathology of systems, hierarchical meaning.
- `business/`: Business logic, value proposition, entity relationships.
- `specs/`: Engineering specifications, MVPs, technical requirements.
- `legal/`: Patent summaries, governance, defensibility documents.
- `assets/`: Placeholders for diagrams, pictures, and videos.

### Workspace Analysis

1. **Extract Knowledge**: Use tools to sample `conversations.json` and `chat.html`.
2. **Synthesize**: Rewrite findings into concise, professional MD files at a "Harvard/CIO level".
3. **Cross-Reference**: Use everything in the workspace and existing local knowledge.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification

- User review of the created MD files and directory structure.
- Verification that all "free stuff" (GCP credits, Drive integration) is documented and planned for.
- A "fitness picture" of the system: a clear, organized overview that allows one to "press play".
