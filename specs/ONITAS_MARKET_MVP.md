# Maroon-Core Specs: ONITAS MARKET

Onitas Market is the primary direct-to-consumer platform for Maroon Foods. It integrates the Nanny Infrastructure (for vendors) and the EBT Split Apparatus (for consumers) into a unified, production-grade food marketplace.

## Customer Journey

2. **Predictive Shopping**: Truth Teller suggests items based on health, budget, and EBT eligibility.
3. **Split Checkout**: Seamless payment using the EBT Split Apparatus.
4. **ShipDay Delivery**: Final-mile delivery managed via ShipDay hooks.

## Platform Pillars

- **Integrity**: Every transaction is audited for "Truth" (Truth Teller).

- **Scale**: Designed for 100k+ users in the WA State region.

## Engineering Directives (for Akim)
