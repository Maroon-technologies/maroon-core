# Maroon-Core: Operational Ontology & Pathology

## The Pathology of Systems

In the Maroon-Core framework, a "pathology" is the study of system failures, inefficiencies, and the underlying logic of operational decay. By understanding the pathology, we build systems that are inherently resilient and self-correcting.

### 1. The Heirarchy of Meaning

Meaning in Maroon is not flat. It is a layered structure:

- **Level 1: Signal (Raw Ingestion)**: Data collected from external sources (e.g., Zillow API, WSDA regulations).
- **Level 2: Pattern (Observation)**: Identifying recurring themes or anomalies in the Signal.
- **Level 3: Protocol (Logic)**: Standard operating procedures (SOPs) triggered by Patterns.
- **Level 4: Ontology (Governance)**: The overarching rules that define what signals are valid and how protocols adapt.

### 2. Operational Defensibility

Every decision made by the AI or the Human operator must be legally and operationally defensible. This is achieved by:

- **Traceability**: Linking every MVP action back to a specific Protocol.
- **Verification**: Cross-referencing against "Enterprise Grade" requirements.

## Current Focus: Signal Ingestion

The immediate priority for Maroon is the ingestion of regulatory and market signals for the **Nanny Project** (Commissary Infrastructure).

### Active "Signals" being Ingested

- Washington State SB 5605 (Microenterprise home kitchens).
- Ghost Kitchen revenue models (BCG Matrix Analysis 2025).
- Seattle/King County Food Unit Permits.
- **Truth Teller**: Integrity-based prediction engine (Patent Pending).
- **EBT Split**: Transaction apparatus for WIC/EBT integration (Patent Pending).
- **Onitas Market**: Direct-to-consumer food platform under Maroon Foods.
